# Buzzer Game

A Jackbox-inspired real-time party quiz platform built for classroom use. A **Host** displays game state on a large screen while **Players** join and answer questions from their mobile browsers.

- Up to 250 players per room, 50 concurrent rooms
- Multiple question types: multiple choice, true/false, fill in the blank, multi-select
- Two grading modes: accuracy-based and participation-based (completeness)
- Local accounts and guest players (no account required)
- Live answer distribution, per-player scoring

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Minimum version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Docker Engine / Docker Desktop | 25 / 4.x | Running the full stack |
| Node.js | 20 | Frontend development servers |
| Python | 3.12 | Integration tests (optional if using Docker only) |

---

## First-time setup

### 1. Copy and configure environment

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

Open `.env` and set:

| Variable | What to do |
|---|---|
| `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` | Choose a strong password |
| `MYSQL_PASSWORD` | Choose a strong password (used by the app) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Update `change_me_app` to match `MYSQL_PASSWORD` |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | Username for the first admin account |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Password for the first admin account |
| `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` | See step 2 |
| `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY` | See step 2 |

### 2. Create the Python virtual environment

Run the included setup script once after cloning. It creates `.venv`, installs all dependencies, and patches the activate script so your `.env` variables load automatically whenever the environment is activated:

```bash
bash scripts/setup_venv.sh
```

Then activate the environment (do this at the start of every terminal session):

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate        # macOS / Linux
```

Your shell prompt will show `(.venv)` when the environment is active, and variables like `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` will already be set from your `.env`. All `python`, `pip`, `pytest`, and `alembic` commands below assume the environment is active.

> **Tip:** Most IDEs (VS Code, PyCharm) can detect `.venv` automatically and activate it for you in integrated terminals. In VS Code, open the Command Palette → *Python: Select Interpreter* and choose the `.venv` entry.

> **Windows:** The setup script targets bash (macOS/Linux). On Windows, create the venv manually (`python3.12 -m venv .venv`), install dependencies (`pip install -r backend/requirements.txt -r tests/integration/requirements.txt`), and load `.env` variables in your shell before running any scripts.

### 3. Generate JWT signing keys

The backend signs tokens with RS256. Run the included helper to generate a key pair and print the values ready to paste into `.env`:

```bash
# With the virtual environment active (cryptography is already installed):
python backend/scripts/generate_keys.py

# Or via Docker (no local Python required):
docker run --rm python:3.12-slim \
  sh -c "pip install cryptography -q && python" \
  < backend/scripts/generate_keys.py
```

Paste the two `JWT_*` lines into `.env`.

### 4. Install frontend dependencies and build

A root-level `package.json` manages a `concurrently` dev tool and provides convenience scripts:

```bash
npm install            # installs concurrently (root dev tool)
npm run install:all    # installs dependencies in all three frontend apps
```

> **Note:** Running `npm run build` is only needed if you want the pre-built apps to be served by Nginx at `http://localhost:8080`. If you plan to use the Vite dev servers (the typical workflow), you can skip the build step entirely.

> **Note:** If the build fails with `EACCES: permission denied` on the `dist` directory, Docker likely created it as root before the build ran. Fix with: `sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) frontend/*/dist`

### 5. Start the Docker stack

```bash
docker compose up
```

On first run, Docker builds the backend image and pulls MySQL, Redis, and Nginx. MySQL takes ~30 seconds to become healthy before the backend starts.

Use `--build` any time you change `requirements.txt` or the `Dockerfile`:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

> **First run note:** On initial startup, MySQL takes 30–45 seconds to initialize the database user, and the backend will **wait — logging `admin_bootstrap_waiting_for_schema` every few seconds — until you run the migrations in the next step**, because its startup needs the database schema, which doesn't exist yet. Both behaviors are normal.

### 6. Run database migrations

Apply the Alembic schema migrations (this runs in its own one-off container, so it works while the backend is still waiting):

```bash
docker compose run --rm backend alembic upgrade head
```

This creates all tables. Within a few seconds the waiting backend picks up the new schema, finishes starting, and bootstraps the admin account from `ADMIN_USERNAME`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD` — no manual step needed.

## Accessing the application

| Interface | URL | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Player app | http://localhost:8080/player/ | Mobile-optimised |
| Host app | http://localhost:8080/host/ | Large-screen display |
| Admin app | http://localhost:8080/admin/ | Course/game/user management |
| API (direct) | http://localhost:8000 | Bypasses Nginx |
| Interactive API docs | http://localhost:8000/api/docs | Swagger UI (dev only) |
| Health check | http://localhost:8000/api/health | Service status |

Log in to the Host or Admin app with the `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` you set in `.env`.

---

## Development workflow

### Starting a session

Run these commands at the beginning of every development session.

**1. Activate the Python virtual environment** in any terminal where you will run Python tools (tests, migrations, scripts):

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you ran `scripts/setup_venv.sh` during first-time setup, this also loads all your `.env` variables automatically (e.g. `ADMIN_PASSWORD`). This is not needed for the Docker stack itself — the backend runs inside its own container. It is needed whenever you run `pytest`, `alembic`, or any Python script directly in your terminal.

**2. Start the Docker stack** (backend, MySQL, Redis, Nginx):

```bash
docker compose up
```

The backend mounts `./backend` and runs with `--reload`, so any Python change takes effect immediately — no restart needed. Logs stream to the terminal.

**3. Start all frontend dev servers** in a single terminal from the repo root:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts all three Vite dev servers concurrently with color-coded, labeled output. **Check the terminal output for the exact URLs** — Vite picks the next available port if the default is already in use, so the numbers may differ from the typical defaults shown below:

```
[host]   VITE ready  →  http://localhost:5173
[player] VITE ready  →  http://localhost:5174
[admin]  VITE ready  →  http://localhost:5175
```

Press `Ctrl+C` once to stop all three.

To start a single app instead:

```bash
npm run dev:host    # typically http://localhost:5173
npm run dev:player  # typically http://localhost:5174
npm run dev:admin   # typically http://localhost:5175
```

In each case, check the terminal output for the actual URL Vite is listening on.

The Vite dev servers watch your source files and hot-reload the browser instantly on every save — no manual rebuild step. They proxy `/api` traffic to the Docker backend, so the full stack works at these ports during development.

> **Backend only?** If you are only changing Python code, you can skip the frontend dev servers and use the pre-built apps at `http://localhost:8080/host/`, `http://localhost:8080/player/`, and `http://localhost:8080/admin/` instead.

### During a session

- **Backend changes** — saved automatically; uvicorn reloads the process within a second.
- **Frontend changes** — saved automatically; the browser hot-reloads via the Vite dev server.
- **Database model changes** — generate and apply a migration:

```bash
docker compose exec backend alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe change"
docker compose exec backend alembic upgrade head
```

### Ending a session

When you are done, stop all running processes:

- Press `Ctrl+C` in each terminal running a Vite dev server.
- Stop the Docker stack:

```bash
docker compose down
```

If you made frontend changes during the session and want `localhost:8080` to reflect them (e.g. for integration testing), run a final build before stopping:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Other migration commands

```bash
# Apply all pending migrations
docker compose exec backend alembic upgrade head

# Revert the last migration
docker compose exec backend alembic downgrade -1
```

---

## Testing

### Integration test suite

Tests run against the live Docker stack (start it first). Dependencies are already installed if you followed the virtual environment setup above. Activate the environment, then run:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/integration/ -q
```

Include timer-expiry edge cases (sets `time_limit_seconds=2` so tests finish quickly):

```bash
python -m pytest tests/integration/ -q --fast
```

### WebSocket smoke test

A quick end-to-end script that creates seed data, plays through a full game, and verifies every event payload (dependencies are included in `backend/requirements.txt`):

```bash
python scripts/smoke_test_websocket.py
```

Override credentials or the target URL with environment variables:

```bash
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin ADMIN_PASSWORD=changeme123 BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000 \
  python scripts/smoke_test_websocket.py
```

### Simulate players

`scripts/simulate_players.py` populates a live room with realistic fake players so you can test the full game loop without real students. It creates temporary local accounts via the Admin API, connects them over WebSocket, and has them answer automatically. All dependencies are already installed by `scripts/setup_venv.sh`.

**Workflow:**

1. Start the Docker stack and open the Host app.
2. Create a room and note the room code shown in the lobby.
3. In a separate terminal (with the virtual environment active), run:

```bash
python scripts/simulate_players.py --room ABCDE1
```

4. Press **Start** / **Next** on the host screen to advance through questions. Players answer automatically. Late players join after their randomised delay and print a message when they arrive.
5. When the game ends, temporary accounts are deleted automatically.

**Player profiles** and default mix:

| Profile | Default % | Behaviour |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| `fast` | 25 % | Answers in 0.5–3 s; rarely skips |
| `normal` | 35 % | Answers in 3–8 s; occasionally skips |
| `slow` | 20 % | Answers in 8–18 s; more likely to skip |
| `absent` | 10 % | Never submits an answer |
| `late` | 10 % | Waits 25–70 s before joining, then answers at a normal pace |

**Common options:**

```bash
# 40 players with a custom profile mix (remainder becomes "normal")
python scripts/simulate_players.py --room ABCDE1 --players 40 \
    --fast-pct 20 --slow-pct 20 --absent-pct 10 --late-pct 10

# Pass the exported game JSON so fast/normal players lean toward correct answers
python scripts/simulate_players.py --room ABCDE1 --players 30 \
    --game-json sample_games/my_quiz.json

# Custom fill-in-the-blank word pool (repeat a word to weight it higher)
python scripts/simulate_players.py --room ABCDE1 --players 25 \
    --fitb-words "spring,spring,summer,summer,summer,autumn,winter"

# Leave temporary accounts in the DB after the run (useful for inspecting scores)
python scripts/simulate_players.py --room ABCDE1 --keep
```

Admin credentials default to the `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variables loaded automatically by the virtual environment. Override them with `--admin-user` and `--admin-pass`, or point at a different backend with `--base-url http://localhost:8000`.

---

## Common operations

### Load the demo quiz

After running migrations, seed the database with a demo game that covers every question type and grading mode:

```bash
python scripts/seed_demo.py
```

This creates a **Demo Course** and a **Buzzer Demo** game with 9 questions (1 point each):

| # | Type | Grading | Question |
|---|------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Multiple choice | Accuracy | Which planet has the most moons? |
| 2 | True/False | Accuracy | A group of flamingos is called a 'flamboyance'. |
| 3 | Multiple choice | Completeness | What is your go-to comfort food? |
| 4 | Multiple choice | Accuracy | What is the largest land animal on Earth? |
| 5 | True/False | Accuracy | The Great Wall of China is visible from space. |
| 6 | True/False | Completeness | Do you prefer coffee over tea? |
| 7 | Fill in the blank | Accuracy (exact) | Chemical symbol for Gold? |
| 8 | Fill in the blank | Accuracy (fuzzy) | Who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet'? |
| 9 | Fill in the blank | Completeness | What country would you visit? |

### Admin interface

The Admin app (`http://localhost:8080/admin/`) provides a full management UI:

| Section | What you can do |
|---|---|
| **Courses** | Create courses; navigate to roster management |
| **Roster** | Upload a Canvas gradebook CSV or a basic CSV roster; activate or deactivate individual entries |
| **Users** | Create local accounts; click any user to grant or revoke course access (HOST/PLAYER) and game access |
| **Guests** | View guest accounts; merge a guest's scores into a real netid account; delete stale guests |
| **Games** | Create games; import a game from a JSON file; delete games |
| **Questions** | Add, edit, delete, and reorder questions within a game; export the game as a JSON file |
| **Sessions** | View completed game sessions and download score exports |

Log in with the `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` from your `.env`.

### Quiz import and export

Games (metadata + all questions including answer data) can be exported and re-imported as JSON files.

**Export** — from the Admin UI, open a game's question editor and click **Export JSON**. Or via the API:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/games/{game_id}/export" \
  -o my_quiz.json
```

Course HOSTs who hold a grant for the game can export it; admins can export any game (the old
`/api/admin/games/{game_id}/export` path still works for admins).

**Import** — from the Admin UI, click **Import JSON** on the Games page and pick a `.json` file. This always creates a *new* game — it never overwrites an existing one. Or via the API:

Every game belongs to one course, and the file never names one: the course comes from the
request. A course HOST imports into their course; admins can also use the admin path with a
required `course_id` query parameter:

```bash
# Course HOST (or admin)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/courses/{course_id}/games/import" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@my_quiz.json"

# Admin alias
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/admin/games/import?course_id={course_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@my_quiz.json"
```

The importing host is granted the new game; a game an admin imports is granted to every HOST of
the course.

The file format is:

```json
{
  "format": "buzzer/game",
  "version": 1,
  "game": { "title": "...", "description": "...", "max_players": 150 },
  "questions": [
    {
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "grading_type": "ACCURACY",
      "prompt": "...",
      "time_limit_seconds": 30,
      "points_value": 1000,
      "config": { "options": ["A", "B", "C", "D"] },
      "answer_data": { "answer_points": [1000, 0, 0, 0] }
    }
  ]
}
```

Question order is determined by array position; `order_index` is assigned automatically on import.

### Export session scores

After a game session completes (or is abandoned), any HOST of its course (or an admin) can
download the scores as CSV, or a standalone HTML summary:

```bash
# Per-player scores: Player, Q1, Q2, …, Qn, Total
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/sessions/{session_id}/export" -o scores.csv

# Canvas gradebook import format (same options as the admin export)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/sessions/{session_id}/export?format=canvas&title=Quiz%201&sis_domain=wisc.edu" \
  -o canvas.csv

# HTML summary (aggregate statistics, no player names)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/sessions/{session_id}/report" -o report.html
```

A session that is still running returns 409. The legacy
`/api/game/sessions/{session_id}/export` (session host or admin) still works.

### Import a course roster

Roster uploads expect either a minimal CSV roster or a **Canvas gradebook export CSV**. When importing, the user can match columns to necessary fields for the players.

See `sample_rosters/*sample_roster_from_gradebook*.csv` for a working examples. Upload via the Admin UI (Courses → Roster → Upload CSV), or via the API:

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"changeme123"}' | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['access_token'])")

# Preview first: counts only, nothing saved
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/courses/{course_id}/roster?dry_run=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@sample_rosters/sample_roster_from_gradebook.csv"

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/courses/{course_id}/roster" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@sample_rosters/sample_roster_from_gradebook.csv"
```

Any HOST of the course (or an admin) can upload. The `mode` query parameter controls what
happens to students missing from the file: `add_only` (the default) deactivates nobody;
`mode=replace` deactivates every active entry not in the upload. The legacy admin path
`/api/admin/courses/{course_id}/roster` always uses `replace`.

### View structured logs

```bash
docker compose logs -f backend       # stream backend logs
```

### Reset the database (destructive)

```bash
docker compose down -v               # removes the MySQL volume
docker compose up --build
docker compose run --rm backend alembic upgrade head   # the waiting backend finishes startup on its own
```

                     └── redis-py   → Redis :6379
```

Real-time communication uses **Socket.io** (python-socketio on the server, socket.io-client in the browser). Game state is stored in Redis for low-latency reads; every player answer is immediately persisted to MySQL.
